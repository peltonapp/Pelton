// flags.ts resolves a language to the flag shown next to it in the picker.
//
// A language is not a country, so the mapping is data rather than something
// derivable: each locale carries the flag people actually associate with it.
// Where the language is spoken in several countries the operating system's own
// region settles it, read locally from navigator.language, so an en-US install
// gets the US flag and an en-GB one the union flag without asking anybody or
// touching the network.
//
// A language with no entry here gets no flag, and the picker shows a neutral
// mark in its place. It used to borrow whatever region the reader's machine
// named, which put Portugal's flag next to العربية for a reader in Portugal
// (#440): a flag nobody chose, attached to a language it has nothing to do
// with. Showing none says what is true.
//
// The svgs come from flag-icons (MIT) and are bundled, never fetched.
